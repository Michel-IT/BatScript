## Overview

This repository contains an interactive batch script designed to optimize Windows 10 and Windows 11 for gaming and network performance. The script implements various tweaks and optimizations that can help reduce system overhead, improve network responsiveness, and enhance frame rates in games.

## Features

The optimization script offers a comprehensive set of features:

- **Multilingual Support**: Available in both English and Italian
- **Windows Version Support**: Compatible with both Windows 10 and Windows 11
- **Network Optimizations**:
  - TCP/IP parameter tweaks for specific network interfaces
  - Global TCP/IP optimizations
  - Reduced network latency for gaming
- **System Optimizations**:
  - Optional Windows Defender management
  - Background service optimization
  - Telemetry and data collection control
  - Notification management
- **Gaming Optimizations**:
  - Visual effects optimization (keeping only essential visual elements)
  - High performance power plan configuration
  - Mouse settings optimization for gaming
  - Windows Game Mode activation
  - Game DVR and Game Bar management
  - Windows 10/11 specific optimizations

## Interactive User Interface

The script features a fully interactive menu-driven interface that:

1. Allows language selection (English/Italian)
2. Offers system restore point creation at startup
3. Provides network interface selection with GUID and IP display
4. Presents categorized optimization options
5. Gives detailed explanations for each optimization
6. Shows current status of each optimization (ON/OFF)
7. Allows selective application of optimizations

## Usage

1. Run the script as administrator
2. Select your preferred language
3. Choose your Windows version
4. Decide whether to create a system restore point
5. Select the network interface to optimize
6. Browse through the optimization categories and enable desired tweaks
7. Apply the selected optimizations
8. Restart your computer for full effect

## Warning

- Some optimizations may affect system functionality outside of gaming
- Disabling security features like Windows Defender will make your system more vulnerable to malware
- Always consider creating a system restore point before applying optimizations

## Compatibility

This script has been tested on:
- Windows 10 (21H2, 22H2)
- Windows 11 (21H2, 22H2, 23H2)
